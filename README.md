# Programming-in-C
This repository is a collection of the programs that I wrote while completing the C Programming with Linux professional certificate program created by Dartmouth (USA) and Institut Mines-Télécom (France). <br />
In the repository, the programs have been divided based on their units and the lessons in which they appeared. The unit titles are as follows: <br />
Unit One --> Getting Started <br />
Unit Two --> Language Foundations <br />
Unit Three --> Modular Programming and Memory Management <br />
Unit Four --> Pointers and Memory Management <br />
Unit Five --> Advanced Data Types <br />
