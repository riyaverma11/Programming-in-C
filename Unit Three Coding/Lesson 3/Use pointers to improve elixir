// The way your elixir works is that anyone who is at least 21 years old becomes 
// ten years younger. However, the elixir does not work on anyone twenty years old 
// or younger - when these people try the elixir, they actually double in age!

// You have already created a main function, shown below. All you need to do now is 
// write a function which accepts the integer pointer "ageAddr" as an argument and 
// modifies the integer this pointer points to according to the rules of your elixir.
// Since you are using pointers to change the value of the variable age, your function
// should have a void return type. 

//Write your function prototype here
void changingAge(int *);

int main(void){
    //! showMemory(start=65520)
	int age = 21;
	int *ageAddr = &age;
	scanf("%d", ageAddr);
	printf("Your current age is %d.\n", age);
	
	//Write your function call here
	changingAge(&age);

	printf("Your new age will be %d!\n", age);
	return 0;
}


//Write your function here
void changingAge(int *ageAddr) {
    //int temp = y;
    if (*ageAddr <= 20) {
	    *ageAddr = (*ageAddr * 2);
	} else {
	    *ageAddr = *ageAddr - 10;
	}
