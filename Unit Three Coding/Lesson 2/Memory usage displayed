// Your job is to write a program that shows, in human-readable form (see below for
// specifics), how much memory a set of variables of a certain type will use. Your 
// program should read a character that identifies the data type ('i' for int, 's' 
// for short, 'c' for char, 'd' for double). Next it should read an integer that 
// indicates how many variables of the given type you wish to store.

// Your program should then calculate the amount of memory required to store the 
// given variables. Your program needs to be written in such a way that it would 
// also perform correctly on other computers. In other words, rather than hard-coding 
// specific sizes for the different variable types, your program needs to use the "sizeof()" 
// function to determine how much memory an individual variable of a given type needs.
