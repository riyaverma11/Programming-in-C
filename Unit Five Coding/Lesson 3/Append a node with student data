// Your new task is to write a function append() which takes as input two pointers:
// the first pointer holds the address of the current end of the linked list of students,
// the second pointer points to a newly created student. Your function should append 
// this new student to the linked list and return the address (a struct student *) of 
// the new end of the list.
