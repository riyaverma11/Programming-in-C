// Your first task is to write a function createStudent() that takes as inputs a 
// string (namely a student's name) and an integer (their age) and that returns a 
// pointer to a struct student which stores this information. Your function should 
// dynamically allocate the memory required for this struct student and then write 
// the student's name and age into this newly allocated memory.
