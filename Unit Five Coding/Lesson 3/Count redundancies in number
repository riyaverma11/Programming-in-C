// Your task is to write a new function countRedun() which takes as input a pointer
// that holds the address of the start of a linked list of digits. Your function 
// should count how many redundancies can be observed in the number stored in this 
// list and return this count of redundancies. A redundancy is a digit which has 
// previously already occurred in the number. For example, in the number 39534, the 
// second '3' is a redundancy.
