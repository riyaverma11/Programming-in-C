// Your program should first read two integers representing the minimum and maximum 
// safe temperatures. Next, your program should continuously read temperatures (integers) 
// that are being provided by the device. Once the chemical reaction is complete the 
// device will send a value of -999, indicating to you that temperature readins are done. 
// For each recorded temperature that is in the correct range (it could also be equal to 
// the min or max values), your program should display the text "Nothing to report". 
// But as soon as a temperature reaches an unsafe level your program must display the text 
// "Alert!" and stop reading temperatures (although the device may continue sending 
// temperature values).
