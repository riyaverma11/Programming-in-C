// The program should read in the number of ingredients (up to a maximum of 10 
// ingredients), then for each ingredient the price per pound. Finally your program
// should read the weight necessary for the recipe (for each ingredient in the same
// order). Your program should calculate the total cost of these purchases, then 
// display it with 6 decimal places.
